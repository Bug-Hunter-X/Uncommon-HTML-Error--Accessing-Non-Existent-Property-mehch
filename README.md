# Uncommon HTML Error: Accessing Non-Existent Property

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML that occurs when attempting to access a property of an undefined variable within a script. This typically results in a runtime error that halts script execution.

## Description
The HTML file contains a script that attempts to access the 'length' property of an undefined variable. This causes a TypeError in JavaScript.

## Solution
The corrected HTML file includes additional checks to handle the case where the variable is undefined before attempting to access its properties.  This prevents the runtime error and ensures more robust error handling.
